## Description 
This application is used to generate notes. The app is ran from a server created using Express.js but it has also been deployed onto the web using a platform called <a href="https://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.  


## Usage
* Express.js
* npm init
* <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid" target="_blank">npm uuid package</a>
* Node.js


## Installation
To install and run this application on your local machine you will need to install the following programs:
* Express.js
* npm uuid package - to create a unique id for each note
* Node.js
* npm init to create the package.json file
* Heroku - If you'd like for the application to be made live with a shareable link


## Instruction
To run this application, first you will need to be sure all programs above are installed. You can check your package.json file to be sure they're all listed.

Then you will need to type 'npm start' into the Terminal in order for the server to start working. From there you should be able to use the PORT number listed in the server.js file like such: localhost:3001 in order to see the app in your browser.



If you would like to view the app with a live link, that doesn't require running anything in the Terminal you can simply go here: <a href="https://note-creater.herokuapp.com/notes" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.
